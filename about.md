# Australian Wine Sales Analysis

This Shiny application is provided as an **example submission** for the ADS506 Module 6 Assignment.

While the app meets the assignment requirements and rubric, it is intentionally **not optimized** for design, usability, or completeness. It should not be viewed as the “best” or only solution to the problem.

You are encouraged to:

-   Use this app as a **reference** for structure and functionality.

-   Apply your own **creativity and problem-solving** in developing your Shiny app.

-   Explore different approaches, features, and designs rather than mimicking this solution.

Your goal is to demonstrate both your technical skills and your ability to communicate insights effectively in a way that reflects your own style.
